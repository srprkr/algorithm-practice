Absolutely! LeetCode 137 (**Single Number II**) is a classic bitwise manipulation problem. To build up the skills for this, here are some recommended LeetCode problems (in order of increasing difficulty):

---

### **1. Single Number (LeetCode 136)**
- **Link:** [LeetCode 136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)
- **Concepts:** XOR, basic bitwise operations
- **Why:** This is the simplest version, where every element appears twice except one. It’s a great intro to using XOR for finding unique elements.

---

### **2. Single Number III (LeetCode 260)**
- **Link:** [LeetCode 260. Single Number III](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/)
- **Concepts:** XOR, partitioning, bitwise tricks
- **Why:** Here, every element appears twice except two elements. It builds on the XOR trick and introduces partitioning based on bits.

---

### **3. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range (LeetCode 201)**
- **Link:** [LeetCode 201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range](https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range/)
- **Concepts:** Bitwise AND, bit manipulation
- **Why:** Helps you get comfortable with bitwise operations and how they interact over ranges.

---

### **4. Counting Bits (LeetCode 338)**
- **Link:** [LeetCode 338. Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)
- **Concepts:** Bit counting, dynamic programming, bitwise
- **Why:** Practice with bitwise operations and understanding how to count set bits efficiently.

---

### **5. Majority Element II (LeetCode 229)**
- **Link:** [LeetCode 229. Majority Element II](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element-ii/)
- **Concepts:** Hashing, Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm
- **Why:** Not bitwise, but helps with the idea of finding elements that appear a certain number of times.

---

### **6. Find the Duplicate Number (LeetCode 287)**
- **Link:** [LeetCode 287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)
- **Concepts:** Bit manipulation, cycle detection
- **Why:** More advanced, but helps with thinking about numbers and their properties in arrays.
